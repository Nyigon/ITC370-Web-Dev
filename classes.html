    <h1>This is a page about my classes</h1>
    <p>I am taking 14 credit hours this semester. I am a senior expected to graduate in spring.<br> 
        As the picture below details, I am taking FIN 380, ITC 370, ITC 560, ITC 563, IDS 275, and LAW 332.<br> 
        I think that my hardest class will be ITC 560 or ITC 370. I think that ITC 560 will be hard because the professor is a more difficult professor. <br> 
        I think that ITC 370 will be hard because I have never been really big into coding, I will say that I have been having fun in html these past two weeks though.<br> 
        I think my easiest class will be IDS 275 because it's the class that RAs take their first semester.
