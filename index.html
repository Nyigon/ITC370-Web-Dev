    <h1>This is an about me page</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kevin Lee. I am an IT major at Missouri State university.
        My field of focus is infrastructure, I use to be a computer science major,
        but I switched to IT because I like the more business aspect of IT.
        I am really excited for this class though because even though coding
        can be extremely frustrating, it can be very rewarding once it works.
        In my free time, I like to play world of warcraft, that's why my name on discord
        is Nyigon. I am also really big into fitness and working out.
        Other than that I like to watch anime, sports, and marvel.</p>
